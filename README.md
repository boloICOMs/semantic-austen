# Semantic Austen
## An Annotated Digital Library
*Semantic Austen* is a project for a Semantic Digital Library of Jane Austen’s manuscripts, created for the Semantic Digital Libraries course of the DHDK master’s degree at University of Bologna, A.Y. 2025/2026. In the website, we present the [annotation campaign](https://app.transkribus.org/invitations/93ef7248-2c41-40b5-ad9a-fbcf46987f68) performed using Tranksribus on some of Jane Austen's draft manuscripts and a prototype of our potential Semantic Digital Library enriched by LOD technologies, available at link [boloicoms.github.io/semantic-austen/](https://boloicoms.github.io/semantic-austen/).
