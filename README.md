# Semantic Austen
## An Annotated Digital Library
Semantic Austen is a project for a Semantic Digital Library of Jane Austen’s manuscripts, created for the Semantic Digital Libraries course of the DHDK master’s degree at University of Bologna, A.Y. 2025/2026. In the website, we present the annotation campaign performed using Tranksribus on some of Jane Austen's draft manuscripts and a prototype of our potential Semantic Digital Library enriched by LOD technologies.
