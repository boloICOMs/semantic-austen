            <h1>Annotation Campaign</h1>
        </section>

        <!-- Task Definition -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Task Definition</h2>
            <p>We decided to do an annotation campaign on some of Jane Austen’s manuscripts, we took three texts from different moments in her life to create an homogeneous batch of texts that cover her lifetime as an author. For the content of the manuscripts we took the diplomatic transcriptions done in the Scholarly Digital Edition <i>Jane Austen fiction Manuscripts</i>. <br>Our aim is to create a Model that can generate an automatic transcription of all Jane Austen’s manuscripts in our theoretical Semantic Digital Library <b><i>Semantic Austen</i></b> that includes all the work done in the existing SDE. Therefore we create this model on Austen handwriting so any other existing holograph texts of her can be transcribed using our model.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Context -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Jane Austen (1775-1817) was an English writer during the English romanticism of the 19th century. Remembered as one of the most important female authors of English literature, known primarily for her novels that explore topics of marriage, social status and economic situation of women through the female perspective of the English society of the 18-19 century. <br>
                Just some of her manuscripts survive the pace of time and are in possession of several english libraries that digitize them  and allow a visualization of them. </p> <br>
            <p>We chose to work on three of her surviving manuscripts available online. </p> 
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Juvenilia:</b> is a collection of stories that she wrote in the span of six years (1787-1793). The first volume of the manuscript is property of the Bodleian Library, Oxford that digitalized and allows a visualization and download of the images. </p></li>
                <li><p><b>The Watsons:</b> is an unfinished work written around 1803 , and probably abandoned after Austen’s father. The incomplete work is divided in two parts, the second is property of the Bodleian Library, Oxford that digitalized and provides the visualization and download of the images. </p></li>
                <li><p><b>Persuasion:</b> her latest novel written before her death; it was published postmortem in 1817. The only surviving holographs of the novel are the first two chapters that are property of the British Library that digitalized and provided visualization of the manuscript.</p></li>
            </ul><br>

            <p>The images of the Bodleian Library, Oxford are under the <a href="https://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/terms/"> CC-BY-NC license</a>  and the British Library are of <a href="https://www.britishlibrary.cn/en/works/jane-austens-juvenilia/">public domain</a></p> <br>
            <p>The Scholarly Digital Edition (SDE) done by King’s College and Oxford called <a href="https://janeausten.ac.uk/index.html"><i>Jane Austen fiction Manuscripts</i></a>. Where they made available the images of the digitized surviving manuscripts in possessions of the several institutions and made an extensive philological work of the manuscripts while providing the diplomatic transcriptions of the texts.<br>
            For the annotation of the manuscripts we use the diplomatic transcriptions included on the SDE as ground truth.</p> <br>
            <p>Although the SDE is a very good digital edition with extensive work, it is slightly outdated and does not make use of semantic and interoperable elements. Hence we would like to propose to make this Scholarly Digital Edition become a Semantic Digital Library called <b><i>Semantic Austen</i></b>.</p>
            <p>Where we consider all the work done in the SDE and take it forward, providing the images of the manuscripts with IIIF, the text of the manuscripts to be downloadable in XML, metadata  in LOD with the link to the authority files of her and the characters in the novel. In addition to providing external links related to Jane Auste, her novel and her life's work to render this highly respected scholarly endeavor a semantic and state of the art website. </p>

        <!-- Corpus Selection -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Corpus Selection</h2>
            <p>As mentioned before we select three texts; <i>Juvenilia</i>, <i>The Watsons</i>, <i>Persuasion</i>  that are representative of different periods of Austen’s work and handwriting (from childhood to maturity). To train the model on different ways of her handwriting since it changes in the lifespan of authors, hence our aim is to create a model that is able to transcribe all the existing Jane Austen manuscripts included in our potential SDL and any others that are in the word. Therefore we decided to not use a pre-existing english HTR model for the training of ours since we wanted to create from scratch from only Austen holographs and for just her writings. </p>
            <p>We began with the annotation of 50 pages between the three manuscripts, later we decided to expand it to make the corpus bigger to make the model work better. <br>
            The final corpus was <b>68 annotated pages</b> between the three texts ( 28 pages of <i>Juvenilia</i>, 25  pages of <i>The Watsons</i> and 15 pages of <i>Persuasion</i>).</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Annotation Guidelines -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Annotation Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Our campaign acts in accordance with the OCR and <a href="https://help.transkribus.org/">Transkribus guidelines</a>.</p>
            <p>Furthermore to carry out the annotation campaign, we relied as said above on the diplomatic transcription of the SDE for the transcription of the texts. This aligns with level 2 of the <a href=”https://ocr-d.de/en/gt-guidelines/trans/level_2_2.html”>OCR-D Guidelines for Ground Truth</a> as their objective is to preserve original text as accurately as possible, like stated in the SDE as well.</p>
            <p>Since the texts in the manuscripts follow a certain logic we defined some internal guidelines for special cases often encountered. We divided in layout and text guidelines.</p>
            
            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Layout Guidelines</h3>
                <p>We defined custom made regions to distinguish structural elements of the page:</p> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Text: region that covers main part of the page, is the actual content of the texts  (Imagine) </li>
                    <li>Title: used in Juvenilia since is a collection of different of stories (imagine)</li>
                    <li>Chapter : used in Juvenilia and Persuasion</li>
                    <li>Page-number: used in Juvenilia (imagine)</li>
                    <li>Section number: used in The Watson since she wrote on separate numbered quires (imagine)</li>
                    <li>Marginalia: used in Persuasion in some pages she include dates (day and month) (imagine)</li>
                    <li>All lines traced on the page that are not a baseline of text were ignored </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Text Guidelines</h3>
                <p>The handwritten text conveyed particularities that had to be specified manually,such as corrections, additions made by the author, we normalized normalize like they did the SDE.</p> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Erasures with a correction on top we defined an extra baseline for the correction and tagged the erased text as strikethrough while we tag the correct text on top as superscript</li>
                    <li>Additions of text (^) defined in an extra baseline and tag as superscript and described with the custom tag addition </li>
                    <li>Erased text on top of which is a correction pointed out as addition by ^, we only tag the correction as superscript </li>
                    <li>Didn’t include (^); expressed with the addition tag</li>
                    <li>Letters written with pencil and later erased; weren’t transcribed</li>
                    <li>We follow diplomatic transcription in punctuation </li>
                    <li>Mʳ and similars normalized into Mr</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Annotation Platform -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Annotation Platform</h2>
            <p>We used for our annotation campaign the platform Transkribus, that allows us to upload the images of the manuscript from the Bodleian Library  and the British Library and carry out our annotation and the training of our HTR Model.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Pilot -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Pilot</h2>
            <p>The pilot was performed thinking about how efficient our model was, since we created it from scratch and did not take an already pre-existing English HTR model. Using 50 pages between the three novels, made us understand that our annotation process was corrected yet we had to make the data-set bigger to receive the results that we expected.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Campaign -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Campaign</h2>
            <p>The campaign began annotating the pilot (50 pages and 8570 words) with the transcriptions of the SDE. as authoritative and labeled as ground truth. We trained our first model selecting 10% as the validation set obtaining a Character Error Rate (CER) of 17.03%.  After this first training model we realized that it was not what we expected and decided to keep this as a pilot and a starting point. </p>
            <p>Consequently we decided to retrain the model, making a “fine-tuning” which meant re-train our model with a base-model (our pilot) and add a fine-tunned set of a small set of annotated pages to make the corpus bigger and get a higher  accuracy of the model. Thus we increased the number to 68 annotated pages and obtained a CER  of 16,47%.</p>
            <p>However we weren’t content with the results, thus  we performed an additional “fine-tuning” with the <i>Transkribus English Handwriting M3</i> based model, trained on English handwriting of 18-20th cent,  however the CER increased at 18% due to overfitting.</p>
            <p>Therefore, to avoid this, we did one last modification to the parameters to train our model. We increased the percentage of pages used for the validation, from 10% to 16%, using the same base model and epochs number (100), and we finally reached a CER of 10,11%.</p><br>
            <p>The graph obtained is the following:</p>
            <img>
            <p>Character Error Rate (CER) is  the ratio of characters that have been transcribed incorrectly by the Text Recognition model. <br>               The learning curve signifies the accuracy of our model: the y-axis is defined as “Accuracy in CER” and is indicated in percentage, The x-axis instead is defined as “Epochs”.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Evaluation of the Results -->
        <section class="content-section evaluation-section">
            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>Evaluation of the Results</h2>
                <p>Our outcome CER of 10.11%, is considered highly functional, since results of 10% or under are considered very efficient. Our model allows a fast and usable application to our SDL since it produces reliable base text that requires minor manual intervention by the recurring complex deletions with corrections.</p>
                
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Comparison: Gemini OCR to Transkribus</h3>
                    <p>After thoughtful consideration on the capabilities of our HTR model created by ourselves on just Jane Austen’s manuscripts in Transksribus we wanted to see the proficiency of others OCRs.  We tested Gemini 3 flash OCR, to understand the efficiency of it by providing just the images without giving any context of the text inside the images.</p>
                    <p>To compare the accuracy of Gemini OCR against what our HTR model with Transkribus is able to do, we took 6 new pages between the novels ( 2 from <i>Juvenilia</i>, 2 from <I>The Watsons</i> and  2 from <i>Persuasion</i>), these pages were not used in the training model.  To compare results we gave these pages to Gemini as well to our HTR model of Transkribus to perform text recognition. </p> </br>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><b>Gemini</b>: gave exceptional results, since it was able to retrieve the text from the images while it understood the provenance of the text, meaning that it understood that they were Jane Austen texts, and identified the specific part of the novel. Provided highly accurate if not perfect text recognition following a diplomatic approach, handling layout, cancellations and superscript corrections. </p> <br>
                    <p><b>Transkribus</b>: was very accurate, it still struggled with the constant cancellations and corrections done by the author, and even in one page it did not understand where the text began missing a part of the text. Therefore our HTR model is very good yet not perfect.</p>

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Ultimately taking into consideration all the work done and analysis performed, the model that we created is a very good starting point to what concerns an annotation campaign and performed a text recognition of handwritten manuscripts with difficult corrections and layout. Nevertheless we realized that an LLM such as Gemini that is trained with thousands of texts have great performances and the results are almost perfect compared to what our small model can do. </p>
            <p>Therefore for the construction of a Semantic Digital Library the use of an LLM with OCR will get better results that our model done in Traskribus, yet this annotation campaign is just a starting point of what can be done in the future and the work we could create for our SDL <b><i>Semantic Austen</i></b>.</p>
